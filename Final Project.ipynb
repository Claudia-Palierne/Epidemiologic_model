    "Previously to the actual Corona virus SARS Cov-2 crisis, several epidemics occurred in history. Already in Antiquity, due to the lack of treatment and knowledge, diseases have decimated entire populations in few months or even few weeks. \n",
    "Nowadays, a scientific discipline named epidemiology study method to find the causes of health outcomes and diseases in populations. It specifically studies the distribution (frequency, pattern) and determinants (causes, risk factors) of health-related states and events in specified populations and bringing on solutions against epidemics and in particular for pandemic situations such as the Corona virus one we are experiencing lately. \n",
    "\n",
    "According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the difference between an epidemic and a pandemic is that “epidemic is a sudden outbreak of a disease in a certain geographical area. Pandemic is an outbreak of a disease that has spread across several countries or continents.” One of the major concerns of this crisis is not only the lack of treatment but also the speed of spread.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computer simulation models are well-established tools within epidemiology and related disciplines. They have proven useful, powerful, and accessible for evaluating questions about the spread of infectious disease within and between many populations and over physical and social spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "A useful measure for the spread of an epidemic is the  basic reproductive number a.k.a R0. It is the expected number of cases directly generated by one case, in a population where all individuals are susceptible to get infected. This measure depends on the contact rate and the recovery time. Computing R0 allows us  to predict the way an epidemic will evolve and thus to find solutions to slow down the contamination. In particular, if R0<1 then an infected individual infects less than one person on average, which means that the disease disappears from the population. Otherwise, if R0>1 then the disease spreads in the population and becomes epidemic.\n"

    "To model the spread of an epidemic, I chose to take a sample of 100 individuals where one is infected amongst them at T0. The subjects move like atoms i.e. they follow attractive/repulsive force. As we used the Lennard-Jones Potential in the previous exercise, it seems that it was too strong. Thus, i decided to modify it for a weaker one. \n",
    "In this model, there is 3 categories of people:\n",
    "- Infected people in red\n",
    "- Recovered people in green\n",
    "- Susceptible of being contaminated in yellow (they haven't been in contact with the disease)\n",
    "\n",
    "To undergo from the susceptible category to the infected category, each individual needs to be in a radius of less than a meter from an infected subject. Since there is still a probability to get or not infected, I left this decision to the appreciation of the reader.\n"

    "The SIR model assumes people carry lifelong immunity to a disease upon recovery, but for many diseases the immunity after infection wanes over time. In this case, the SEIRS model is used to allow recovered individuals (group R) to return to a susceptible state (group S). Specifically, ξ is the rate which recovered individuals return to the susceptible statue due to loss of immunity. Another group has been added in this model, the exposed state(group E). For most infectious diseases, there is a latent period between being infected and becoming infectious: the exposed group (E). Upon being infected (group I), individuals will move to this group at a rate βSI/N and remain there for an average period of 1/σ before moving into the I group.\n",
    "If there is sufficient influx to the susceptible population, at equilibrium the dynamics will be in an endemic state with damped oscillation. A simple loop will helps us understand the different states that contain the SEIRS model :\n",
    "Suscpetible → Exposed → Infectious → Recovered → Susceptible again\n",

    "To make the model more realistic I decided to add vital dynamics, meaning that the population can fluctuate by adding a birth rate and a death rate. Where μ and ν represent the birth and death rates, respectively, and are assumed to be equal to maintain a constant population, the ODE then becomes:\n",
