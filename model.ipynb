    "Previously to the actual Corona virus SARS Cov-2 crisis, several epidemics occurred in history. Already in Antiquity, due to the lack of treatment and knowledge, diseases have decimated entire populations in few months or even few weeks. \n",
    "Nowadays, a scientific discipline named epidemiology study method to find the causes of health outcomes and diseases in populations. It specifically studies the distribution (frequency, pattern) and determinants (causes, risk factors) of health-related states and events in specified populations and bringing on solutions against epidemics and in particular for pandemic situations such as the Corona virus one we are experiencing lately. \n",
    "\n",
    "According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the difference between an epidemic and a pandemic is that “epidemic is a sudden outbreak of a disease in a certain geographical area. Pandemic is an outbreak of a disease that has spread across several countries or continents.” One of the major concerns of this crisis is not only the lack of treatment but also the speed of spread.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computer simulation models are well-established tools within epidemiology and related disciplines. They have proven useful, powerful, and accessible for evaluating questions about the spread of infectious disease within and between many populations and over physical and social spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "A useful measure for the spread of an epidemic is the  basic reproductive number a.k.a R0. It is the expected number of cases directly generated by one case, in a population where all individuals are susceptible to get infected. This measure depends on the contact rate and the recovery time. Computing R0 allows us  to predict the way an epidemic will evolve and thus to find solutions to slow down the contamination. In particular, if R0<1 then an infected individual infects less than one person on average, which means that the disease disappears from the population. Otherwise, if R0>1 then the disease spreads in the population and becomes epidemic.\n"

    "To model the spread of an epidemic, I chose to take a sample of 100 individuals where one is infected amongst them at T0. The subjects move like atoms i.e. they follow attractive/repulsive force. As we used the Lennard-Jones Potential in the previous exercise, it seems that it was too strong. Thus, i decided to modify it for a weaker one. \n",
    "In this model, there is 3 categories of people:\n",
    "- Infected people in red\n",
    "- Recovered people in green\n",
    "- Susceptible of being contaminated in yellow (they haven't been in contact with the disease)\n",

Specifically, ξ is the rate which recovered individuals return to the susceptible statue due to loss of immunity. Another group has been added in this model, the exposed state(group E). For most infectious diseases, there is a latent period between being infected and becoming infectious: the exposed group (E). Upon being infected (group I), individuals will move to this group at a rate βSI/N and remain there for an average period of 1/σ before moving into the I group.\n",

    "Then, the matrix K = f * v**(-1) is known as the next-generation matrix. The entry K_ij is the expected number of secondary infections of type i caused by a single infected individual of type j, again assuming that the population of type i is entirely susceptible. K is a positive matrix and this means that, from the Perron-Frobenius Theorem, there will be one eigenvalue that is real, positive, and strictly greater than all others. The largest modulus of the eigenvalues or spectral radius of K is the basic reproduction number of the model and the previous equations of the models comes from it.\n",

    "If R0 is a well-used measure to predict the spread of an epidemic, it still has its limitations. First of all, R0 depends entirely on the models, meaning that for one disease we can have several different R0, depending on the choice of the model used. Secondary, R0 is set at the start of an epidemic, before widespread immunity starts to develop and before any attempt has been made at immunization. Meaning that, R0 isn't a trustworthy measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, nowadays, a new measure has been created, named the effective reproduction number, Re, sometimes also called Rt. This measure defines the number of people in a population who can be infected by an individual at any specific time. It changes as the population becomes increasingly immunized, either by individual immunity following infection or by vaccination, and also as people die. We compute it by multiplying R0 by the fraction S of the population that is susceptible.\n",

    "\n",
    "Finally, the last problem that occurs with deterministic epidemic models is that they can't take in consideration mutations in the virus. In fact, not much has been done to model the dynamics of mutations of pathogen explaining its effort to escape the host's immune defense system after it has infected the host. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell,  deterministic models are a powerful tool to analyze the spread of an epidemic. They are easy to compute and give quite good information on the spread of an epidemic. However, we need to have the exact parameters for the model to be accurate, which is not always an easy task and sometimes predictions cannot be made in advance. \n",
    "There is another type of model called stochastic models. They possess some inherent randomness. The same set of parameter values and initial conditions will lead to an ensemble of different outputs. However, stochastic models are considerably more complicated and really hard to compute.\n",
